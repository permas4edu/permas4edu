The example is adapted from [A JAYA based algorithm for Design optimiza-tion of a turbocharger subject to vibration and stress concentration constraints](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/336612989_A_JAYA_based_algorithm_for_design_optimization_of_a_turbocharger_subject_to_vibration_and_stress_concentration_constraints)

Thanks to Dr. Ibrahim MLAOUHI for private communication. His support is greatly appreciated.
