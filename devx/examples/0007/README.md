The example is adapted from [Rotordynamics Continuum Finite Element Formulations from a Structural and Multibody Dynamics Perspective](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/378148473_Rotordynamics_Continuum_Finite_Element_Formulations_from_a_Structural_and_Multibody_Dynamics_Perspective)

Thanks to Francesco Trainotti for sharing the underlying finite element model and private communication.
