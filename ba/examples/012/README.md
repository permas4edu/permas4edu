The example is adapted from [Straightforward Superposition: An Analytic Framework to Buckling in Orthotropic Rectangular Plates](https://doi.org/10.1061/JENMDT.EMENG-8554)

Thanks to Zhaoyang Hu and Rui Li for sharing a finite element model and private communication. Their support is greatly appreciated.
