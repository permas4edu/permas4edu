The example is taken from 
[Investigative Study of the Effect of Damping and Stiffness Nonlinearities on an Electromagnetic Energy Harvester at Low-Frequency Excitations]( https://doi.org/10.3390/machines12010030)

$$ m \ddot{z} + c_1 \dot{z} + c_3 \dot{z}^3 + k_1 z + k_3 z^3 = m \Omega^2 Y \sin(\Omega t) $$
